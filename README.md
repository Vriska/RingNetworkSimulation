# RingNetworkSimulation

This is a simulation of a hypothetical improvement to the outdated IBMs Token Ring system simulated under the assumtion that there is going to be heavy traffic under some nodes
and the weight and intensity around that node is going to be normally distributed ie -there is a lot of traffic around certain servers of the ring. This simulation method shows in 
such cases, wait time and other metrics are optimized if the token was randomized in motion between servers rather than completeing the entire ring which leads to a notable 
increase in wait time due to having to go an highly active section of the ring before first .
